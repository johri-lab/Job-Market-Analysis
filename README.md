### US Job Market Analysis

We analyze the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) due to its relevance in providing insights into job market dynamics, essential for international masterâ€™s students like us entering the workforce in the US. We believe this data will help us understand job openings, hires, and separations across industries and regions, crucial for job seekers.

The visualizations are created using R
