# Introduction
> We analyze the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) due to its relevance in providing insights into job market dynamics, essential for international master's students like us entering the workforce in the US. We believe this data will help us understand job openings, hires, and separations across industries and regions, crucial for job seekers.

We plan on studying the following analysis:
1. Identifying industries with high job openings.
2. Analyzing geographic regions based on job market demands.
3. Understanding the particular sectors that are growing or declining in job openings for making an informed career decisions.
5. Understanding seasonal impact on job market for planning our job search in a better manner.
